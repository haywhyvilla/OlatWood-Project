        <h3 class="faq-title">OUR HISTORY</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          OLAT Furniture was founded in 2020 as Interior Options Ltd in response
          to the inability of local furniture manufacturers to deliver the
          design and international quality standards required by our very
          discerning clientele. It was primarily an interior design consultancy
          service providing interior design services to mostly oil companies in
          Nigeria but has since entered into furniture manufacturing using
          cutting edge technology and experienced Italian technical expertise.
